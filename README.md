## Requirements

* Node.js v5.10 or greater
* npm v2.11.1 or greater

## Getting Started

To get started you'll need to install the devDependencies for this project. In the project root folder type:
```bash
$: npm install
```


Scrolling Jigsaw uses [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) v3.10.0 for production builds and [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) v2.11.1 for development and serving files on http://localhost:9000

### Development
In the project root folder, using terminal enter:

```bash
$: npm run dev
```

Navigate to to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in your web browser.

webpack-dev-server is configured to reload the browser upon saving files in the **src/** directory

### Production

In the project root foler, using terminal enter:

```bash
$: npm run build
```

Production builds are generated by webpack and stored in the **build/** folder.

By default Production and Development builds use:

* [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile ES2015+ JavaScript to support IE 9 and above.

* [UglifyJS Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin) to minify your JavaScript.

* [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) to minify your CSS.
